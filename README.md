Hello. 
This repository contains an Explorative Data analysis of different router models ad their sales.
The analysis is based on the total orders making you understand the volume of router purchases, Popular router hence identifying our most sought_after router model , sales across states to explore variations in sales across regions and the return analysis examining reasons and patterns for product returns.
The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of various routers available in the market and helping users make informed decisions.
The process began by opening the three data sets.
I did the .info() to know the number of columns in the datasets.
.column() to get the columns
I was merging the three datasets in pairs.
After performing the merging process i performed te cleaning process on the merged dataset. Used .isnull.sum() to deal with the missing values.
To get the statistical calues of each merged dataset i did .describe().
.shape 
Explored the data and had visualizations to use in analyzin the data. Made use of histogram to get the frequencies.
Bar graph: A bar plot is a plot that presents data with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent.
Boxplot : Depicts numerical data graphically through their quartiles. The box extends from the Q1 to Q3 quartile values of the data, with a line at the median (Q2).
Histogram: A histogram is a representation of the distribution of data.
Scatterplot: helped to see the distribution of the data.
I was able to discuss the distributions as pertaining to the given dataset.
I created a markdown to give a summary of the flow and what i was doing.
I also did a powerpoint presentation of the summary of what i had done.
Had data issues for consideration, this was mainly on some of the things i noticed when dealing with the data.
Like in a situation of a missing value in a column.
Made conclusions that i had according to the analysis i had just done.
Recommendations of what need to be done in future so as to have accurate analysis of data.
Had some references.
Thank you
